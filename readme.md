Imstore
----------------
Encode basically any file into image
First make it binary -> byte -> then save all the byte data as the colors and alpha channels of a PNG image, so that the file can be hosted anywhere.
Then Decode it back without any loss

Future plans
---------------
Encode multiple files on the same image/video for better encapsulation
Make it into video.
Host it on some site.
Use it on another project
